Tuesdays, 7 - 8:50pm // C108  
Instructor: Stephanie Smith // scsmith@calarts.edu  
TA: Taehee Kim // taeheekim@alum.calarts.edu // Office Hours TBD

How can computation be reconsidered within the critical contexts of an art practice? Students will be introduced to the aesthetic possibilities of combining art making, computer programming and digital technology. The classes will explore the fundamentals of programming in a variety of IDEs combined with the investigation of physical media, installation and interactive design. The class assignments will lead to a focus on the expressive capabilities of the human body in a sensor-based environment. The core concepts will involve a dialogue between physical action and digital information. A final group project will implement the body, sensors, and microcontrollers using computer programs written in class.

## Mini-Projects

There will be a "mini-project" at the end of each unit (a total of three). They are due on the last day of the unit. They consist of continuing development of whatever you've built in class during that unit and then showing it to the class ("show-and-tell").

## Final Project

A final project will be due at the end of the semester. You will be creating an installation, which will be installed in C108 on the last day of class.

## Grading

| Attendance, Participation | **33%** |
| -- | -- |
| **Mini-Projects (3)** | **33%** |
| **Final Project** | **34%** |

* **Assignment**: Mini-project: Make a "mini-installation" with your sensor. It doesn’t need to be polished, and it doesn’t even have to work 100%, but I do want you to try using the sensor with some thought behind how you want us to interact with it (more than just using your hand to test the sensor). Working in groups for this assignment (and all assignments) is fine. If you don't have a sensor, pair up with someone that does, or use your knob/potentiometer for now.

## Shared Code/Assignments

Google Drive where you can upload your code:  
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vMucFCi4nhILJDcJugT7xk998hOX3EI5?usp=sharing

If you're comfortable with GitHub, add your code as repositories (contact me for access):
https://github.com/comprecon18/

I'd encourage you to share your code so your classmastes can take a closer look. Sharing and building off existing code is a great way to learn and develop new ideas.
